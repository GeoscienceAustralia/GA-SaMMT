Morphological Surface Tool Slope
--------------------------------


This tool classifies an area into three **surface** categories: *Plane*, *Slope* and *Escarpment* from a slope gradient grid.
The three **surface** categories are classified based on the values of slope gradient.
Note that the slope gradient grid can be generated from software other than ArcGIS using a neighbourhood size othe than 3 by 3.

The *surface* classification method is based on the seabed morphology scheme published in `Dove, D., Nanson, R., Bjarnad√≥ttir, L., Guinan, J., Gafeira, J., Post, A., Dolan, M.; Stewart, H.; Arosio, R, Scott, G.. (2020). A two-part seabed geomorphology classification scheme (v.2); Part 1: morphology features glossary. Zenodo. <http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4075248>`_.

The followings are the key steps of this tool.

1. Reclassify the slope gradient raster into a three-class raster based on the following criteria:

    * If slope gradient < 2, class = 1 (*Plane*)
    * If 2 < slope gradient < 10, class = 2 (*Slope*)
    * If slope gradient > 10, class = 3 (*Escarpment*) 

2. Apply Majority FIlter to the reclassified raster a number of time using the *number_neighbors* option of *Eight* and the *majority_definition* option of *Half*. The number of time is defined by the *nuMF* input parameter.
3. Convert the filterred raster into polygons.
4. Select the polygons with areas smaller than the *Area Threshold* parameter  and merge them into their largest neighbours to obtain the final **surface** features as output.
