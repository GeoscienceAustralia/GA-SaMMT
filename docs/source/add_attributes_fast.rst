Add Attributes Fast
===================


This toolset contains several tools to calculate various attributes for each bathymetric high or low feature.
These attributes can be used to describe the characteristics of each feature.
They can also be used to classify or assign each feature into a feature type based on a morphometric classification scheme.
The difference between the fast set and the standard set, is that the fast set offers multiprocessing capabilities to more efficiently calculate attributes for each bathymetric high or low feature.
