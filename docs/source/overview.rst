Geoscience Australia's Semi-automated Morphological Mapping Tools
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Seabed characterisation requires the measurement, description and classification of physical features on the seabed.
A key first step in this process is the identification of morphological forms, as derived from bathymetry data.
To facilitate rapid and consistent morphological mapping, Geoscience Australia has developed several semi-automated ArcGIS Python toolboxes that:

* Generate polygons from bathymetry surfaces that represent *bathymetric high* and *bathymetric low* seabed features
* Calculate metrics/attributes to describe the characteristics of the feature polygons
* Classify individual polygons into one of the bathymetric *high* or *low* seabed morphological feature types

The toolboxes adopt the suite of terms as presented in the glossary of seabed morphology features defined by :cite:`dove_2020_4075248`.
